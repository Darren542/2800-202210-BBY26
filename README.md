## Running The Project ##
The main branch is designed to run on a localhost.

### Languages Used ###
The source code is written using Javascript, CSS, and HTML.<br/>
The database is written for MySQL<br/>

### Software Needed ###
An IDE such as Visual Studio Code is recommended to edit and view the code.<br/>

### Creating Your Local Copy ###
You will need to install git to clone and make changes to your local repo.<br/>
Once git is install create a local folder and run command prompt in it<br/>
If you want to work on our repo you can run
```
C:\CST-Term1\K9-Meet>git clone https://github.com/Darren542/2800-202210-BBY26
```
If you want to start your own repo, create/login into a Github account, navigate to https://github.com/Darren542/2800-202210-BBY26. Then click fork to start your own repo that you can then clone.

### Getting Your Database Running ###
You will need a locally run MySQL database. <br/>
Our suggestion is to install XAMPP and use it to host a MySQL server.<br/>
Once XAMPP is installed and is running a MySQL server you can access it with command prompt
``` 
C:\Apps\xampp\mysql\bin>mysql -u root -p
Enter Password:
``` 
Password will be blank, just hit enter.<br>
Once the locally run MySQL database copy and paste the contents of database.sql into command prompt to created the apps database, tables and some starter accounts and app data.

### Running Your node.js Server ###
You will need to install node.js and npm to run your local version of K9-Meet<br>
Once you have node.js and npm installed you should be able to check with
```
C:\CST-Term1\K9-Meet>npm version
{
  npm: '8.3.1',
  node: '16.14.0',
  v8: '9.4.146.24-node.20',
  uv: '1.43.0',
  zlib: '1.2.11',
  brotli: '1.0.9',
  ares: '1.18.1',
  modules: '93',
  nghttp2: '1.45.1',
  napi: '8',
  llhttp: '6.0.4',
  openssl: '1.1.1m+quic',
  cldr: '40.0',
  icu: '70.1',
  tz: '2021a3',
  unicode: '14.0',
  ngtcp2: '0.1.0-DEV',
  nghttp3: '0.1.0-DEV'
}
```
```
C:\CST-Term1\K9-Meet>node -v
v16.14.0
```
Once those are both running you can either install the needed node.js packages to run the app locally in a node-modules folder in the project or globally<br>
add a -g after 'install' to install globally
```
C:\CST-Term1\K9-Meet>npm install express express-session fs mysql2 crypto path
```
Once all the needed node packages are installed you can start the app
```
C:\CST-Term1\K9-Meet>node index.js
K9-Meet listening on port 8000!
```
