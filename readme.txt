This assignment is 95% complete.

The default password for all users in 123

Most of functionality for milestone #4 is present, but the code could use better documentation.

We have implemented both a pseduo shopping cart and a timeline.

The shopping cart can be seen by:
1. Log in to a user (eg.username: dluck pw: 123)
2. Openning the hamburger menu and clicking create
3. Choose either create group or create event works for both
4. Fill in details of the event or group
5. click save & quit button - this will create a save in the database
6. will take you back to create page where it will have banner letting you know about your saved shopping cart/creation
7. You can click load and it will bring you back into event/group creation with the details you had already filled out or Click delete if you no longer want that save.
8. You can then finish creating the event/group from your save by clicking finish, doing this will delete the saved object and create the event/group.
One problem currently is that images are not saved and loaded in your saved event/group creations. And will have to be reinputted if you tried to save one.
I also have images limited to 150kbs max atm.
